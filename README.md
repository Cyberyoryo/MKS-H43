# Mainboard support
MKS H43 is a serial LCD, it uses the TTL-uart to communicate with mainboard. So in theory, MKS H43 supports all mainboard with serial communication and running marlin V2.X firmware. As there are so many types of 3d printer mainboards, different mainboard has different uart available and unavailabe, so we make some test of the compatibility of MKS H43 and some mainboards, please refer to the wiki page.
